# üêØ Tati's Terrific Trivia üêØ

This trivia app tests your animal knowledge! With 10 easy questions, answer True/False to find out if you're ready to be a zoologist. Using React and Vite for the front end and Postgres, Node, and Express for the back end, this app connects to the Open Trivia Database to pull 10 Easy True/False Animal questions and present them to the user one by one. Users are able to save their user name for a chance to be on the leader board of Top 10 Players! If they've played before, users can update their score as well.

## Future Plans

Right now, Tati's Terrific Trivia can only be played on the easy setting. Future iterations will take user input to set the difficulty level to either easy, medium, or hard. Other ideas include to switch the answer choices to multiple choice and allow the user to decide that as well as they're gearing up for the quiz on the landing page. Eventual versions of this game will also allow for other trivia categories.
