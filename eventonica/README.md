# Eventonica

Eventonica is full-stack web app that uses React and Vite for the front end and Express for the back end. It is connected to a local database to store event data. Users are able to manage Techtonica events with features such as create, update, delete, and search. Each event has a "Category" feature to allow for better organization and classification. The Search bar will query events with matching characters in the event title or category. With this app, Techtonica's Event Manager will be able to keep important details such as location, date, time, and descriptions organized and efficiently stored in a local database.
